# Parsers_Resources

Author: Vi Varga

This repository includes a sampling of useful scripts I've written as part of my MSc Thesis work, that I have chosen to post publicly prior to the completion of my Thesis project. A number of other scripts will be made publicly available upon the completion of my Bioinfomatics Thesis project. At that time, this repository will likely become a general-purpose repository for useful scripts that are not tied to a specific project that I am working on. 


## iprScan_Parser.py

This script parses the .tsv results file output by the InterProScan program, when it is run with the following options: `--goterms --iprlookup --pathways`.


## sonicParanoid_Parser.py

Parsing the primary results file of SonicParanoid, ortholog_groups.tsv.
